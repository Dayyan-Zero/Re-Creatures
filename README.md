# Re-Creatures

![banner](external/banner.png)

## About

**Re-Creatures** is my personal vision for Minecraft mobs. The aim is to bring a little realism for the animals, and a more fantasy vibe for the monsters, all while following my [Adjustify](https://www.curseforge.com/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fwww.planetminecraft.com%252ftexture-pack%252fadjustify%252f) vanilla-plus-ish style.

Changes go from the smallest texture and model changes like the squid, all the way to full overhauls like the cats. And some, like the villagers and iron golems, have a little bit of everything. You may even encounter "new mobs" like the pigmen farming away in a village.
